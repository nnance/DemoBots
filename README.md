#  DemoBots: Building a Cross Platform Game with SpriteKit and GameplayKit

This is a fork of the DemoBots project upgraded to the latest version of Swift and XCode.  I intend to maintain this project as Apple
continues to release new versions of the language, OS and tools.

I have tested this on an iPhone 13, iPad Pro 12.9, Macbook Air M2.

[Here](appleReadMe.MD) is the original Apple documentation.

### Changes

The biggest change in this repo besides the Swift language migration is scene loading.   I completely rewrote the SceneOperation class to
upgrade the async resource loading.

### Build

Xcode 14.0, Swift 5, OS X 10.12 SDK, iOS 12.0 SDK, tvOS 12.0 SDK

### Runtime

OS X 10.12, iOS 12.0, tvOS 12.0
